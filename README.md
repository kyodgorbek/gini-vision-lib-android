Gini Vision Library for Android
===============================

The Gini Vision Library provides Activities and Fragments for capturing, reviewing and analyzing photos of invoices and remittance slips.

By integrating this library in your application you can allow your users to easily take a picture of a document, review it and - by implementing the necessary callbacks - upload the document to the Gini API for analysis .

Communication with the Gini API is not part of this library. You can either use the [Gini API SDK](https://github.com/gini/gini-sdk-android) or implement communication with the Gini API yourself.

The Gini Vision Library can be integrated in two ways, either by using the *Screen API* or the *Component API*. The Screen API provides Activities for easy integration that can be customized in a limited way. The screen and configuration design is based on our long-lasting experience with integration in customer apps. In the Component API we provide Fragments for advanced integration with more freedom for customization. We strongly recommend keeping in mind our UI/UX guidelines, however.

Customization of the Views is provided mostly via overriding of app resources: dimensions, strings, colors, texts, etc. Onboarding can also be customized to show your own pages, each consisting of an image and a short text.

The Gini Vision Library can be used on smartphones and tablets, too. On smartphones it has been designed for portrait orientation only and will always switch to portrait orientation in both Screen API and Component API usage. On tablets both portrait and landscape orientations are supported.

It is not required to limit your Activities extending the Screen API's abstract Activities or your Activities hosting the Component API's Fragments to portrait orientation. The Gini Vision Library takes care of limiting to portrait on smartphones.

Due to in-memory image handling applications using the Gini Vision Library must enable large heap.

Tablet Support
--------------

We enabled landscape orientation and adapted some UI elements to offer a better experience to tablet users. We also removed the camera flash requirement for tablets since many tablets with at least 8MP cameras don't have an LED flash (like the popular Samsung Galaxy Tab S2). 

For more information please consult our guide for [supporting tablets](http://developer.gini.net/gini-vision-lib-android/html/updating-to-2-4-0.html#tablet-support).

> **Note:** Please see our minimum hardware recommendations for tablets below. We recommend implementing corresponding hardware checks for the Gini Vision Library to deliver optimal results to users. As mentioned many tablets with at least 8MP cameras don't have an LED flash (like the popular Samsung Galaxy Tab S2) and we don't require flash for tablets. For this reason the extraction quality on those tablets might be lower compared to smartphones.

Documentation
-------------

Furhter documentation can be found in our 

* [Integration Guide](http://developer.gini.net/gini-vision-lib-android/html/) and
* [Javadoc](http://developer.gini.net/gini-vision-lib-android/javadoc/index.html)

Architecture
------------

The Gini Vision Library consists of four main screens:

* Onboading: Provides useful hints to the user on how to take a perfect photo of a document.
* Camera: The actual camera screen to capture the image of the document.
* Review: Offers the opportunity to the user to check the sharpness of the image and to rotate it into reading direction, if necessary.
* Analysis: Provides a UI for the analysis process of the document by showing the user a loading indicator and the image of the document.

### Screen API

The Screen API provides a main Activity with which to start the Gini Vision Library and two abstract Activities which you need to override to react to events coming from the Gini Vision Library.

In order to support the widest variety of Android versions while keeping the look and feel consistent, we use the Android Support Library and provide only Activities subclassing the AppCompatActivity.

### Component API

The Component API provides four Fragments which you can include in your own layouts. This allows you more freedom to customize the Gini Vision Library, without being restricted to AppCompatActivities and the Gini Vision Library Theme.

To allow usage even if you aren't using the Android Support Library, we provide a Standard and a Compat version of each Fragment.

Example
-------

We are providing example apps for the Screen API and the Component API. These apps demonstrate how to integrate the Gini Vision Library and how to use it with the Gini API SDK to analyze photos of documents.

Requirements
------------

Screen API: Android 4.0+ (API Level 14+)  
Component API: Android 4.2+ (API Level 17+)

### Phone Hardware

* Back-facing camera with auto-focus and flash.
* Minimum 8MP camera resolution.
* Minimum 512MB RAM.

### Tablet Hardware

* Back-facing camera with auto-focus.

Installation
------------

To install add our Maven repo to the root build.gradle file and add it as a dependency to your app module's build.gradle.

build.gradle:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://repo.gini.net/nexus/content/repositories/open'
    }
}
```

app/build.gradle:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'net.gini:gini-vision-lib:2.5.0'
}
```
